# User Authentication Flow with 2FA, JWT, and Phone Verification

This project implements a robust **user authentication flow** with essential features such as **sign-up**, **sign-in**, **password recovery**, **phone verification**, **two-factor authentication (2FA)**, and **account verification**. Designed for scalability and security, it utilizes **JWT** for authentication and incorporates a seamless multi-step process to ensure user safety.
